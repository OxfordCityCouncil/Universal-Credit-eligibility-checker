# Universal Credit eligibility checker

A decision-tree form to enable a user to determine whether they should   
apply for Universal Credit or Housing Benefit.                           
                                                                          
Based on information on https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility  
as at 20 October 2017. That information could be clearer than it is.

I've prioritised readability over optimisation; there may be a better    
way to either make it more readable and/or more optimal. It's of course  
a bare HTML/JavaScript rendition, you will style accordingly for your    
own site's look and feel.

Feel free to use and change as you see fit, but please credit myself

always nice to be told if other people are using it.
